    "As usual when dealing with DICOM files, vendors love to do whatever they want with the standard and sometimes they do not provide all the metadata required to do the \"conversion\" trick. I have identified 3 fields that may be missing in the GE CT scans: ReconstructionDiameter, SpacingBetweenSlices and SlicePositon. So far, it seems easy to reconstruct them. If any other appears with another dataset, let me know.\n",

    "The parameter `bAdjustContrastParam` activates the adjust of the contrast to make it more readable. It is not 100% as good as a real DICOM viewer but it helps a lot to make it more easy to visualize in the Sonalleve SW. The function `ConvertCTtoMRI` has the following extra parameters controlling the adjustment of contrast. Default values seem to produce reasonable results:\n",
    "* `lowhighin` (default [0,1]) is a two-value list that  indicates the normalized range of the datatype dynamic to preseve from the input image. [0,1] means that values from 0 to 2^16-1 will be kept. It must have a values from 0 to 1, and lowhighin[1]>lowhighin[0]\n",
    "*  `lowhighout` (default [0,1]) is a two-value list that   indicates the normalized range of the datatype dynamic to strecth the data. [0,1] means that the input range will be stretched in values ranging from 0 to *2^16-1. \n",
    "* `gamma`  (default 1.5) is the exponent coefficient used to adjust background luminosity. Values inferior to 1 increase the luminosity. **This seems to be the best parameter to play around**. Values larger than 1.5 seem to work nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Very important** If using a `gamma` value greater than 1 the image may look \"*completely*\" dark on the Sonalleve. The opposite will happen with `gamma` less than 1 (a hyperintense image).  Just adjust the brightness in the Sonalleve and the figure will appear correctly. "
